# GraceTracks Agent Activity Log

Log of agent-driven development, decisions, and milestones on the GraceTracks project.

### 2026-06-09 — Fix unreachable Upload button on the upload view

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/cool-ptolemy-egt3ee`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**: The app shell clips overflow (`#app` and `.gt-main` are `overflow:hidden`), so each view must own its scrolling. `.gt-upload` had no scroll container, so once a stem tile held a file its taller selected-state body grew the grid row and pushed the footer past the clip boundary — the "Upload Recordings" button became unreachable. Made `.gt-upload` flex to fill height and scroll internally (`flex:1; min-height:0; overflow-y:auto`).

**Changes**: `src/styles/components.css` — `.gt-upload` is now a self-scrolling flex item. No JS change; confirmed existing select-mode upload already fills only the provided stem slots and never deletes existing stems.

### 2026-06-09 — Fix role check: read from public.users.role (not app_metadata)

**Agent**: Claude (claude-opus-4-8)
**Branch**: `claude/grace-tracks-upload-auth-ifwppq`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**: Owners/admins/editors were denied the upload button, page, presign,
and DB write because GraceTracks gated everything on `app_metadata.role`, which
GraceChords never populates. GraceChords' source of truth is `public.users.role`
(its `useAuth` reads `users.role`; the DB has `get_user_role()`/`has_min_role()`).
Re-pointed all three GraceTracks layers at `public.users.role`.

**Changes**:
- `src/lib/auth.js` — `getUser()`/`onAuthStateChange()` now fetch the role from
  `public.users` (self-select under RLS) and attach it as `user.role`;
  `isEditorPlus()` reads `user.role` (falls back to app_metadata).
- `functions/api/presign.js` — role check now queries
  `/rest/v1/users?id=eq.<uid>&select=role` with the caller's token instead of
  reading `app_metadata.role`.
- `supabase/migrations/20260609000000_songs_stem_role_from_users.sql` (new) —
  recreates the `songs_write_editor` policy to gate on a `public.users` subquery
  instead of JWT `app_metadata.role`. **Must be applied** (Supabase SQL editor or
  `supabase db push`) for uploads to write the song row.
- `CLAUDE.md` — corrected constraint #6 + DB rule to state the role lives in
  `public.users.role`.

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean; `npm test` 21/21.

### 2026-06-09 — GraceChords-style navbar (theme toggle, profile + settings dropdowns, drawer)

**Agent**: Claude (claude-opus-4-8)
**Branch**: `claude/grace-tracks-upload-auth-ifwppq`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**: Replaced the simple GraceTracks navbar with a vanilla-JS port of the
GraceChords navbar so the two sites match. Desktop shows the brand, two links
(GraceChords home + GraceTracks song list), a gear "settings" dropdown, and a
profile dropdown. The settings tray contains a dark/light theme pill toggle
(GraceChords' iOS-style segmented control, Sun/Moon), persisted to localStorage
and applied via `<html data-theme>`. The profile dropdown holds the editor-only
Upload link (in place of GraceChords' song editor), a link to the GraceChords
profile page, and Sign Out; signed-out users get a Sign In button. On ≤820px a
hamburger opens a slide-in drawer with the same links/settings/auth, matching the
GraceChords breakpoints (hamburger ≤820px, larger touch targets ≤640px). Only
toggles relevant to GraceTracks are included (theme only — no locale/chord-style).

**Changes**:
- `src/lib/theme.js` (new) — theme apply/toggle/init ported from GraceChords
  (`gracetracks.theme` storage key, defaults dark).
- `src/ui/navbar.js` (new) — `createNavbar({ navigate })` factory: brand, links,
  settings tray, profile dropdown, hamburger drawer; outside-click + Esc dismiss;
  body-scroll lock; `setUser()` updates auth slots and editor-gated Upload.
- `src/ui/icons.js` — added Settings/Sun/Moon/LogOut/ChevronRight/User lucide icons.
- `src/main.js` — boots `initTheme()` + `createNavbar`; removed the old
  `renderNav`/`updateNavAuth` and their click wiring.
- `src/styles/components.css` — ported gc-navbar / settings-tray / pill-toggle /
  user-dropdown / drawer styles + `gc-btn--secondary`/`--destructive`.
- `src/styles/main.css` — removed old `.gt-navbar*`; added bridge tokens
  (`--primary`, `--primary-text`, `--safe-b`, `--drawer-surface`, `--drawer-text`)
  that the shared nav styles expect (kept tokens.css verbatim).

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean; `npm test` 21/21. (No headless browser in
the sandbox, so not visually screenshotted.)

### 2026-06-09 — Upload page: song search, WAV→M4A, instrument-slot rename

**Agent**: Claude (claude-opus-4-8)
**Branch**: `claude/grace-tracks-upload-auth-ifwppq`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**: Reworked the editor-only upload page so recordings attach to an
existing GraceChords song chosen via a search bar that mirrors the GraceChords
word-prefix search ranking, with a "create a new song" fallback. Up to 10 stems
slot into fixed instrument tiles (each file is renamed to its instrument slot in
R2). WAV files are converted to M4A in-browser before upload where WebCodecs AAC
encoding is available, falling back to uploading the raw WAV otherwise. Auth
gating (editor/admin/owner) and the role-gated nav Upload button already existed
and were left intact — no new database values added.

**Changes**:
- `src/lib/songSearch.js` (new) — trimmed copy of the GraceChords word-prefix
  search ranking (title + artist), returns best-match-first.
- `src/audio/encodeM4a.js` (new) — `isM4aEncodeSupported()` + `wavFileToM4a()`
  using WebCodecs `AudioEncoder` (mp4a.40.2) + `mp4-muxer`. Upload-time only;
  graceful fallback to raw WAV where unsupported (iOS Safari/Firefox).
- `src/ui/uploadSong.js` — song-search combobox (loads full catalog; editors can
  read all rows via the editor RLS policy), selected-song card + "new song"
  toggle; per-tile target-filename hint; WAV→M4A on submit; existing songs get an
  `update` of only stem fields (no metadata clobber), new songs `upsert`.
- `src/styles/components.css` — search dropdown / selected-song card / new-song
  toggle styles; upload-slot scribble-strip icon resized 24→36px (downsized from
  the mixer's 44px) per request.
- `package.json` — added `mp4-muxer`.

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean; `npm test` 21/21.

### 2026-06-09 — X32 instrument icons (BMP → SVG)

**Agent**: Claude (claude-opus-4-8)
**Branch**: `claude/sharp-albattani-l44ptt`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**: Replaced the Lucide instrument icons with the Behringer X32 scribble-strip
set (drums, perc, bass, elec, keys, synth, vox, strings). The source 64×64 BMPs (white
line-art on black) were vectorised with `potrace -i` and rewritten to `currentColor` so
they inherit the theme. Lucide still backs `click`/`ambient`/`master` and all transport/UI
icons.

**Changes**:
- `X32-icons/*.bmp` — source bitmaps (from github.com/mamarguerat/behringer-icons, GPL-3.0).
- `scripts/convert-x32-icons.sh` — reproducible potrace pipeline (BMP → currentColor SVG).
- `src/assets/channels/*.svg` — 8 vendored instrument icons + `ATTRIBUTION.md` (GPL-3.0).
- `src/ui/icons.js` — `channelIcon()` returns the X32 SVG (Vite `?raw` import, class
  injected) for the 8 instruments; falls back to Lucide for click/ambient/master.
- License is compatible: GraceTracks is GPL-3.0, same as the icon source.

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean; `npm test` 21/21; rendered preview confirmed all 8
trace cleanly on the dark theme.

**Note**: the old `public/icons/channels/*.svg` are now unused (kept for now; safe to remove).

### 2026-06-09 — Lucide icons + Stop/Rewind transport button

**Agent**: Claude (claude-opus-4-8)
**Branch**: `claude/sharp-albattani-l44ptt`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**: Migrated the hand-rolled inline SVG icons to Lucide (matching GraceChords'
icon system) and added a second transport button that acts as Stop while playing (halt +
reset to start) and Rewind while stopped (reset to start only).

**Changes**:
- Added `lucide` dependency. New `src/ui/icons.js` helper imports only the icons we use
  (tree-shaken) and renders them to SVG-string markup so they drop into the existing
  innerHTML template literals — no framework, no runtime DOM scanning.
- `src/ui/transport.js`: play/pause, ambient (→ Waves), meters (→ AudioLines), click
  volume down/up (→ Volume1/Volume2) now use Lucide. Added Stop/Rewind button
  (`data-action="stop"`) left of play; `setPlayState` swaps its icon (Square ↔ SkipBack)
  and label with play state. Play button now selected by class (data-action toggles).
- `src/ui/mixer.js`: back-link arrow → Lucide ChevronLeft.
- `src/ui/uploadSong.js`: stem remove "✕" → Lucide X.
- `src/styles/components.css`: `.gt-transport__stop` (secondary surface fill) + icon size.
- Kept bespoke (no suitable Lucide equivalent): count-in "1234" block, metronome glyph,
  per-stem channel artwork in `public/icons/channels/`. Volume down/up use level icons
  (Volume1/Volume2) as the closest approximation to decrement/increment.

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean; `npm test` 21/21.

### 2026-03-30 — Schema Documentation & Agent Logging Setup

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/schema-docs-agent-log-YtCEH`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**:
Documented GraceTracks database schema and created this agent activity log to track future Claude and agent-driven work.

**Changes**:
- Updated `README.md` with comprehensive schema documentation including:
  - Songs table structure (slug, stem_slug, title, artist, tempo, time_signature, default_key, gracetracks_url, has_stems, is_deleted)
  - Stem file storage location (Cloudflare R2)
  - Architecture overview (Vite, Web Audio API, Supabase, R2)
  - Development setup instructions
  - Environment variable requirements
- Created `AGENT_LOG.md` to track agent activity and decisions

**Reasoning**:
The project was missing documented schema details despite using a structured database. This makes it harder for agents to understand data relationships and constraints. Adding comprehensive documentation helps:
1. Onboard new agents with context about data models
2. Track architectural decisions and their rationale
3. Maintain clarity on what database fields map to UI elements
4. Reference stem file organization for audio loading

### 2026-04-13 — Stem Upload & Song Creation

**Agent**: Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6)
**Branch**: `claude/stem-upload-song-creation-YYi3i`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**:
Implemented the full stem upload pipeline: Supabase auth, role-gated upload UI, Cloudflare Pages Function for presigned R2 URLs, and migration SQL for RLS policies.

**Changes**:

- `supabase/migrations/20260413000000_songs_stem_upload.sql` — Idempotent migration: ensures `has_stems`, `stem_slug`, `gracetracks_url` columns exist; enables RLS; creates `songs_read_public` (anon SELECT) and `songs_write_editor` (editor/admin/owner INSERT+UPDATE) policies keyed on `auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role'`
- `src/lib/auth.js` — New auth module: `getUser`, `getSession`, `signIn`, `signOut`, `isEditorPlus`, `onAuthStateChange`
- `src/ui/signIn.js` — Modal overlay component for email/password auth; dismisses on ESC or backdrop click
- `src/ui/uploadSong.js` — Upload page: song metadata form, 10 drag-and-drop stem tiles (drums/perc/bass/elec/keys/synth/vox/strings/click/ambient), sequential R2 upload via presigned URLs, Supabase upsert
- `functions/api/presign.js` — Cloudflare Pages Function: verifies Supabase JWT, checks editor+ role, generates presigned R2 PUT URL using `aws4fetch`; handles CORS
- `src/main.js` — Added `/upload` route; auth-reactive navbar with Sign In/Out and Upload buttons; upload page mounted/unmounted on auth changes
- `src/styles/components.css` — New styles for `.gt-signin-overlay`, `.gt-signin`, `.gt-upload`, `.gt-upload__stems` grid, per-tile states (empty/selected/uploading/done/error), indeterminate progress animation
- `wrangler.toml` — Added `[[r2_buckets]]` binding for local dev
- `.env.example` — Documented new Pages Function secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
- `README.md` — Updated schema docs; added upload pipeline and Pages Function setup sections
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — Added `aws4fetch` dependency

**Key Decisions**:
- Used presigned R2 PUT URLs (client uploads directly to R2) rather than proxying through the Worker to avoid memory limits on large audio files
- Sequential stem uploads (not parallel) to avoid simultaneous large requests on mobile
- Auth state managed in `main.js` with `onAuthStateChange`; upload page re-renders when auth changes
- Slug validated as `[a-z0-9-]+` in both frontend and Pages Function

**Manual Setup Required**:
1. Run migration SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Create R2 API token with Object Read & Write permissions
3. Set Pages Function secrets in Cloudflare Pages dashboard
4. Add R2 bucket binding in Pages → Settings → Functions

### 2026-06-07 — Register Existing Stems (metadata-only song registration)

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/pensive-hamilton-3wi8p`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**:
Closed the gap where stems uploaded to R2 by hand never appeared in GraceTracks because nothing wrote the `songs` row. Added a `/register` page that writes song metadata only (no file upload) after probing R2 to confirm the stem folder exists, plus a one-off SQL script to register three already-uploaded songs.

**Changes**:
- `supabase/seed/register-existing-stems.sql` — Idempotent upsert (on conflict slug) registering Great is the Lord, Let Us Sing to the Lord, In the Name of the Lord. slug = kebab URL key; stem_slug = snake_case R2 folder. Includes pre-flight SELECT to reconcile with any existing GraceChords rows.
- `src/ui/registerSong.js` — New editor+ page: metadata form, slug → snake_case stem_slug auto-derive, "Check R2 folder" that probes `STEMS` via `resolveStemUrl` and requires ≥1 found stem before enabling Register, then upserts the `songs` row with `has_stems = true`.
- `src/main.js` — Added `/register` route, navbar link (editor+), panel mount/hide, and auth-change re-render guard mirroring the upload page.
- `src/styles/components.css` — Added `.gt-register__check-result` styles; otherwise reuses `.gt-upload*` layout.

**Key Decisions**:
- Kept registration separate from `/upload` (which couples file upload + DB write) rather than overloading it.
- Require a successful R2 probe before allowing registration so empty songs can't be registered.
- `stem_slug` is its own field (defaults to slug with hyphens → underscores) because the hand-uploaded folders are snake_case while slugs stay kebab-case.

### 2026-06-08 — Stem sync rework: master-clock phase-lock loop

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/nifty-shannon-lWyhl`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**:
Reworked the audio engine to eliminate inter-stem drift. The previous patches
only ever fixed *start* alignment (seek-before-play, no-op seek gate); they never
addressed the real cause — each `HTMLMediaElement` runs on its own media clock,
independent of the AudioContext and of every other element, so the stems drifted
apart over the length of a song. `AudioBufferSourceNode` (sample-locked for free)
stays off the table because of the iOS-OOM "streaming only" constraint, so instead
the engine now runs a software phase-lock loop.

**Changes**:
- `src/audio/engine.js`:
  - Designates the longest-loaded stem as the **master clock**; transport position
    (`currentTime`) is read from it rather than from a synthetic clock.
  - Added a 200 ms drift-correction loop (`_correctDrift`) that nudges every other
    stem's `playbackRate` toward the master — proportional (gain 0.6, capped ±5%)
    above a 15 ms deadband for pop-free convergence, with a hard re-seek only past a
    400 ms gap (stall/background-throttle recovery).
  - `loadStem` now sets `preservesPitch=false` (+ vendor prefixes) so nudges are a
    clean resample rather than a transient-smearing time-stretch.
  - `pause`/`stop`/`seekTo` reset all `playbackRate`s to 1.0; `dispose`/`stop` stop
    the correction loop. Added `getSyncReport()` for console diagnostics.
- `src/audio/engine.test.js`:
  - Added single-step correction tests (9a–9f: ahead/behind nudge, deadband reset,
    hard-seek recovery, master never adjusted, no-op when paused).
  - Added "no drift over time" convergence simulations (9g–9j): converges a 120 ms
    start skew into the deadband within ~5 s, and holds a continuously ±0.4%-skewing
    clock under ~16 ms for a 4-min (and 10-min) song — proving error stays bounded
    instead of accumulating. Full suite: 21 passing.

**Key Decisions**:
- Kept the streaming `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` architecture (no `decodeAudioData`,
  no framework) per project constraints — the fix is a control loop, not a rewrite.
- Click/ambient stems keep rolling at gain 0 when "off," so toggling them mid-playback
  is an instant in-sync unmute; the corrector keeps them locked like any other stem.
- Soft `playbackRate` correction over hard re-seeks to avoid audible pops during normal
  playback; hard seek reserved for large-gap recovery.

### 2026-06-08 — DAW-sync investigation: on-device spike + Option B plan

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/nifty-shannon-lWyhl`
**Status**: In Progress (planning + validation harness)

**Summary**:
Investigated what it takes for playback to behave like a DAW (sample-locked, zero
drift). Built a self-contained on-device spike (`public/stem-spike.html`) to measure
whether full-decode is viable, then wrote a full implementation plan for the streaming
AudioWorklet engine (Option B) and added an on-device streaming test to the spike page.

**Spike findings** (iPhone, iOS 18.7 / Safari 26.5, `great_is_the_lord`: 8 stems, 6.24 min,
48 kHz stereo):
- Decode is fast (1.75 s for all 8). Single-clock sample-locked playback sounds tight on iOS.
- Int16 PCM total: 548 MB (too heavy to keep resident on constrained devices).
- Float32 hold: 1.10 GB → **tab force-refresh (OOM) even on a flagship**.
- Conclusion: `AudioBuffer` is always Float32 and `AudioBufferSourceNode` needs the whole
  buffer resident, so full-decode (Option A) is non-viable for real-length songs. The path
  is Option B — one clock, but stream PCM into it.

**Changes**:
- `docs/STREAMING_ENGINE_PLAN.md` — full Option B plan: architecture (R2 → mp4box demux →
  WebCodecs `AudioDecoder` → per-stem ring buffers → `AudioWorklet` mixer under one clock),
  ~12 MB bounded memory model, seek/loop/transport design, browser-support matrix + fallback
  (WAV-PCM streaming or today's phase-lock engine), API compatibility (keep `engine.js`
  surface so the UI is untouched), milestones M0–M5, risks, and the on-device validation plan.
- `public/stem-spike.html` — added an "Option B — Streaming worklet test": a WebCodecs AAC
  capability probe and an `AudioWorklet` "stem-mixer" that plays the decoded stems fed in
  200 ms chunks at a configurable lookahead, reporting underruns (glitches) and peak ring
  (playback) memory, plus a seek test. Results merge into the existing JSON export.

**Key Decisions**:
- Killed Option A with hard on-device evidence before building it (the spike's purpose).
- v1 streaming feeds the worklet via `postMessage` transfer (no `SharedArrayBuffer`) to avoid
  forcing COOP/COEP + CORP headers on the cross-origin R2.
- Keep the phase-lock `MediaElement` engine as the fallback for browsers without WebCodecs audio.

### 2026-06-08 — Streaming engine (Option B) — production build, gated

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/nifty-shannon-lWyhl`
**Status**: In Progress (built + build-verified; awaiting on-device runtime validation)

**Summary**:
After M0 passed on-device (worklet sample-locked, 0 underruns, 12.3 MB ring, WebCodecs
AAC supported), built the production streaming engine. It is gated behind `?engine=stream`
so production behaviour is unchanged (phase-lock stays the default) until validated on a
real device.

**Changes**:
- `src/audio/stream/pcmPlayerProcessor.js` — `pcm-player` AudioWorkletProcessor: one per
  stem, content-locked via absolute sample positions (self-heals on underrun). All players
  share the AudioContext render-quantum clock → sample-locked to each other.
- `src/audio/stream/demux.js` — mp4box (2.3.0) MP4 demux → AAC `EncodedAudioChunk`s + the
  `AudioSpecificConfig` (WebCodecs `description`) + per-chunk absolute sample positions;
  plus a lazy WAV PCM reader fallback.
- `src/audio/stream/streamEngine.js` — orchestrator: per-stem `pcm-player → gain → analyser
  → master` graph (so existing fader/mute/solo/meter code is unchanged); WebCodecs decode-
  ahead scheduler that only decodes ~4 s past the playhead (resident PCM ~tens of MB);
  clock-based transport (play/pause/seek/loop/count-in). Implements the exact public API of
  `engine.js`. Worklet loaded via a Blob URL (`?raw` import) — the iOS-proven path.
- `src/audio/engineFactory.js` — capability detection + `?engine=stream|phase` override;
  dynamic-imports the streaming engine so mp4box (~195 KB) is code-split out of the default path.
- `src/ui/mixer.js` — construct the engine via `createEngine()` instead of `new AudioEngine()`.
- `package.json` — added `mp4box` dependency.

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean (streaming engine code-split to its own chunk);
`npm test` 21/21. Runtime path (mp4box demux/ASC extraction, WebCodecs decode, seek) is
NOT yet validated in a browser — to be confirmed on-device via `?engine=stream`.

**Key Decisions**:
- Per-stem player worklets (not one mixer worklet) to preserve the Gain/Analyser graph and
  thus all existing fader/mute/solo/metering code.
- Default stays phase-lock; streaming is opt-in until on-device validation, then flip
  `_defaultToStreaming()` in the factory to capability detection.

### 2026-06-08 — Streaming engine validated on-device + made the default

**Agent**: Claude
**Branch**: `claude/nifty-shannon-lWyhl`
**Status**: Completed

**Summary**:
Validated the streaming engine end-to-end on real devices and made it the default.
On iPhone (iOS 18.7 / Safari 26.5) and macOS Safari & Chrome, the full pipeline works:
all 8 stems demux (mp4a.40.2, real 2-byte ASC) → `AudioDecoder` configures → decode-ahead
→ per-stem `pcm-player` worklets play sample-locked. Scrub (while playing and paused),
click/ambient toggles, and pause all stay tight. Resident PCM ~tens of MB.

**Changes**:
- `src/audio/engineFactory.js` — `_defaultToStreaming()` now returns `streamingSupported()`,
  so browsers with AudioWorklet + WebCodecs AAC get the streaming engine automatically;
  others fall back to the phase-lock `MediaElement` engine. `?engine=phase` / `?engine=stream`
  still override.
- `CLAUDE.md` / `CODEX_CONTEXT.md` — rewrote constraint #2 to describe the two-engine setup
  (stream-decode in bounded chunks; never hold a whole song of PCM); added the new modules
  to the codebase map.

**Build/verify**: `npm run build` clean (streaming engine code-split); `npm test` 21/21.

**Remaining (optional)**: broaden device matrix (Android Chrome / Firefox / older iOS — all
covered by capability detection + fallback); decide whether to remove the `stem-spike.html`
diagnostic page; consider SW-precache tuning for the streaming chunk.
